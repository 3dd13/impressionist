* New model method - @widget.unique_impression_count_ip  - This gives you unique impression account filtered by IP (and in turn request_hash since they have same IPs)
* @widget.unique_impression_count now uses request_hash.  This was incorrectly stated in the README, since it was using ip_address.  The README is correct as a result of the method change.
